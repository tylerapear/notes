# Wireless Networks

Use radio waves or other wireless signals to connect various devices

## Wireless Router

Similar to a plain old router, routes network traffic ([packets](packets.md)) wirlessly

#### Components

1) WAN (Wide Area Network) Port - Connects the router to the internet
2) LAN (Local Area Network) Port - Provides wired connections for local devices
3) Antennae - Transmits and recives wireless signals to and from devices
4) Processor & Memory - handles routing and other tasks

## Cell Towers

- A site where equipment broadcasts a wireless signal to the surrounding area (called a 'cell')
- Devices seamlessly connect from cell tower to cell tower when they move between cells
- Managed by a Base Station Controller (BSC). Handles the transfer of sessions between towers when a device moves between cells.
- Connected to the core network (internet) through backhaul links (usually fiber optic)

## Frequencies

- Also called oscillation rates.
- Measured in hertz (Hz)
- To much of the same frequency at the same time causes interferance
- Slower frequencies -> further range, but carry less data (slower)
- Faster frequencies -> carry more data faster, but with a shorter range

#### Commmon Frequencies

1) **2.4 GHz:** Older wifi standards. Better at penetrating walls, but more prone to interference.
2) **5 GHz:** Newer wifi standards. Faster speed, shorter range.
3) **Cellular Bands:** For 4G (LTE) and 5G. From 700MHz (low range) - 2.6GHz (mid range) - 28GHz+ (high range)
